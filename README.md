# Actors

A multi-agent conversation system backend that enables AI agents to collaborate and provide specialized expertise across different domains.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents (Math Tutor, History Tutor, Triage Agent) that collaborate and hand off tasks
- **MCP Integration**: Extensible tool system using Model Context Protocol servers
- **Client Tools Support**: Enable client-side tool execution with callback mechanisms
- **Authentication & Persistence**: Supabase integration for user management and conversation storage
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based endpoints with streaming support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- UV package manager

### Installing UV

If you don't have UV installed yet:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
