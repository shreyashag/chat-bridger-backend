# Actors

A powerful AI agent framework that enables client-side tool execution with flexible LLM provider support and extensible multi-agent capabilities.

## Features

- **Client-Side Tool Execution**: Revolutionary approach allowing tools to run directly in the client with secure callback mechanisms
- **Flexible LLM Provider Support**: Choose your own AI provider - OpenRouter, OpenAI, Ollama, or any compatible service
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Support for specialized agents that can collaborate and hand off complex tasks
- **Conversation Management**: Full conversation lifecycle with star, archive, list, delete, and automatic title generation
- **MCP Integration**: Extensible tool system using Model Context Protocol servers for seamless tool connectivity
- **Authentication & Persistence**: Complete user management and conversation storage with Supabase
- **Real-Time Streaming**: FastAPI-based endpoints with NDJSON streaming for responsive user experiences
